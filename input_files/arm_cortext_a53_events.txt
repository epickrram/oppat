0xC5	RD_ALLOC	Read allocate mode.
0xC6	ERR_PRE_DECODE	Pre-decode error.
0xC7	STALL_SB_FULL	Data Write operation that stalls the pipeline because the store buffer is full.
0xC8	SNOOP_SCU	SCU Snooped data from another CPU for this CPU.
0xC9	BR_COND	Conditional branch executed.
0xCA	BR_IND_MISPRED	Indirect branch mispredicted.
0xCB	BR_IND_MISPRED_ADD	Indirect branch mispredicted because of address miscompare.

0xD0	MEM_ERR_L1I	L1 Instruction Cache (data or tag) memory error.
0xD1	MEM_ERR_LD1	L1 Data Cache (data, tag or dirty) memory error, correctable or non-correctable.
0xD2	MEM_ERR_TLB	TLB memory error.
0xE0	STALL_IQ_OTHER	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle that the DPU IQ is empty and that is not because of a recent micro-TLB miss, instruction cache miss or pre-decode error.
0xE1	STALL_IQ_INST_MISS	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle the DPU IQ is empty and there is an instruction cache miss being processed.
0xE2	STALL_IQ_ITLB_MISS	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle the DPU IQ is empty and there is an instruction micro-TLB miss being processed.
0xE3	STALL_IQ_PD_ERR	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle the DPU IQ is empty and there is a pre-decode error being processed.
0xE4	STALL_ILK_OTHER	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle there is an interlock that is not because of an Advanced SIMD or Floating-point instruction, and not because of a load/store instruction waiting for data to calculate the address in the AGU.  Stall cycles because of a stall in Wr, typically awaiting load data, are excluded.
0xE5	STALL_ILK_AGU	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle there is an interlock that is because of a load/store instruction waiting for data to calculate the address in the AGU.  Stall cycles because of a stall in Wr, typically awaiting load data, are excluded.
0xE6	STALL_ILK_SIMD_FP	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle there is an interlock that is because of an Advanced SIMD or Floating-point instruction.  Stall cycles because of a stall in the Wr stage, typically awaiting load data, are excluded.
0xE7	STALL_MISS_LD	Attributable Performance Impact Event Counts every cycle there is a stall in the Wr stage because of a load miss.
0xE8	STALL_MISS_ST	Attributable Performance Impact Event.  Counts every cycle there is a stall in the Wr stage because of a store.
